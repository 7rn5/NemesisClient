## History  
This client was initially developed as a gift for a Japanese friend.
Its early versions didn't anticipate growing to this scale, so it may still have occasional bugs.
While there are currently no plans to discontinue development, please be aware that it may eventually be discontinued. (I'd love to keep it going as long as possible :D)
